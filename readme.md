# Wikipedia Scraper

A simple web scraper that accesses the [FTSE 100 index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100_Index) Wikipedia page, searches for the Constituents table, then goes to each company page to gather the company information then writes in in a CSV.

You can find the final output here: [ftse_100_company_info.csv](https://github.com/miubogdan/WikiScraper1/blob/master/ftse_100_company_info.csv)
